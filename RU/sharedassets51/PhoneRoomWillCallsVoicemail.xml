    <line speaker="message" style="skeleton">I was just parking my car. I had to parallel park it. The street that I live on was full. It just got cold today, for the first time in a long time, so I had the heat on, and whenever you have the heat on in an old car it definitely smells a certain way.</line>

    <line speaker="message" style="skeleton">It smells kind of like ... you can smell that it's hot. You can feel it, too. The smell is from the car itself, like from the engine. There's been a lot of smoking going on in that car, so it's not exactly a pleasant smell, but it's definitely strong and it's definitely there.</line>

    <line speaker="message" style="skeleton">With the windows down, you can also smell that it's cold. So you get both. That feeling, together, is super familiar, if you've been in old cars a lot.</line>

    <line speaker="message" style="skeleton">Anyway, I was parking, and I had to go in-and-out about it, like, three times, but when I finally finished parking it was `perfect`. Both wheels against the curb.</line>

    <line speaker="message" style="skeleton">And that's when I had the double memory of when I first learned how to drive, and my mom taught me how to parallel park, and she told me this story about when her dad — who was a motorcycle cop — taught her how to parallel park. Every time she parallel parked, he would take out a dime, and if he could fit the dime between the wheel of her car and the curb of the street, then she had to do it again.</line>

    <line speaker="message" style="skeleton">She didn't do that for me. But every time that I got upset about having to do it again, she would tell me that at least I didn't have to be a dime's distance away from the curb.</line>

    <line speaker="message" style="skeleton">I learned how to drive in the fall, and I got that smell a lot during that time. I don't know when my mom learned to drive.</line>
