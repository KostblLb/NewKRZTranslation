  <scene name="weird" nextScene="stay-long">
    <line speaker="thomas">You didn't see the guy. Tall, kinda stooped over, limping bad. Looked like an old drunk if you ask me. I bet they were both drunks; breaking in here looking for a place to sleep it off.</line>

  <scene name="stay-long" nextScene="end">
    <line speaker="thomas">I just feel bad for that old dog, getting dragged all over by a couple of drunks. Old dog like that should be sleeping on a porch somewhere. But that's loyalty for you.</line>
