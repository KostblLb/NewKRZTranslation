    <line speaker="junebug">Naturally. Do you have any of those little ceramic, um, I want to say `porcelain` figurines? You know, `slice-of-life`?</line>

    <line speaker="junebug">They don't sell too well? More of a truck stop thing, huh? Yeah, I get it — you deal in `authenticity`. None of those prefab truck stop antiques, right? You deal in `aura`.</line>

  <scene name="junebug-collection" nextScene="movie-something-happens">
    <line speaker="junebug">Nah, I just like to look at them sometimes. I like how they all have their jobs just `painted on`, you know? Like I saw one in a gas station the other day who could have been either a milkman or a cop — he had that hat and uniform, right? And who knows how it went down — maybe they just had more blue paint that day ... "American Moments Figurine. Cop. Thirty-five dollars."</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">They posed him next to a dusty milkman, his brother. Fifteen dollars.</line>
