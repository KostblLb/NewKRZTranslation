  <scene name="approach">
    <line>What looked from the road like a haphazard pile of wood is actually a worn boat. It's in poor repair. Perhaps it was abandoned, and only recently salvaged.</line>

  <scene name="rock">
    <line>The creek is low this time of year, and the rock is only a little wet from condensation. He weighs the field recorder in his hand, listens to bending boards and hammering.</line>

    <line>One of the figures stops working, sets down a caulk gun, and looks over at Johnny. The other finishes tearing at a bit of rotten wood stuck to the hull, then turns.</line>
    <line>After a minute or two, Johnny stops the recorder. File that one under &quot;water sounds.&quot;</line>
