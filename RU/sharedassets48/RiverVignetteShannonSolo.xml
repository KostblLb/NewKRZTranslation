    <line>The boat was loaded to capacity with black plastic bags and a few larger pieces of furniture wrapped in a blue tarp. Three paddled — the two adults and the older child. The two younger children slept.</line>
    <line>They'd been traveling all night, first by car and then for the last few hours by boat. Hungry and tired, they didn't plan to stop until they reached West Virginia, where a relative had offered to take them in.</line>
    <line>But the adults were happy to take a break from paddling in weary silence. They asked her about her river journey.</line>

    <line>They'd brought some food. The kids had picked the garden clean earlier in the day, so they'd been snacking on fresh bell peppers and tomatoes, and some crackers, rationed carefully for the trip.</line>

    <line>They were sympathetic. No miners in their family, but he was once injured at a warehouse job, and had to fight for disability pay — they knew what these companies were like, and what it was like to have to assert your humanity to them.</line>

    <line>He was alert and easygoing. His day was just beginning. He used to work at `<variable name="tiki-bar-carl-failed-business" />`, but it closed down. When he wasn't selling flowers, he'd hang out by the highway and listen to the sounds the cars made, study them carefully, and then learn to reproduce them with his own voice. He was working on a record.</line>

    <line>He said they took turns. The water was cold and the floating bicycle, while technically marvelous, wasn't quite buoyant enough for the both of them. Swimming is hard work — the hardest work that dog had ever done, he expected.</line>
    <line>They'd been traveling this way for most of the night: struggling through the icy water, stopping to recover when they could find a rock large enough to start a small campfire. He had his belongings stuffed into a weathered guitar case at the end of a thin rope. It floated pretty well, so he only had to keep an eye on it and occasionally free it from a rock or some driftwood it was caught on.</line>
    <option goto="guitar">She asked if he had a guitar in his case, or just clothes.</option>
    <option goto="dinghy-ride">She invited him to ride a ways on the dinghy.</option>

    <line>He never worked from photographs, so his paintings could be divided into two categories:</line>
    <line>There were the ones he painted from life, and the Echo River was a very good source for these because its currents were so unpredictable and the tunnels so dark. He rendered these in oil paint, by lamplight, working for hours cross-legged on the porch of his houseboat-slash-studio.</line>
    <line>Then there were the ones he painted from memory — mostly the memory of a single wreck he encountered as a much younger man, picking up litter where the coastal highway cleaves to the rocky beaches of northern California. These were done in watercolor. He preferred to work on them in the morning, in a room he rented near the airport in Louisville.</line>
    <line>He had some postcard-sized sketches in charcoal, too, of `The Iron Pariah`. It wasn't a wreck, exactly, but it felt right. He tried to scribble one down every time he encountered it, though it was so unpredictable, and he was so focused on details, he usually just ended up with a handful of inscrutable marks.</line>

    <line>She gave in, shut off the motor and floated for a while. Then, she knew what she'd been craving: a moment of silence.</line>
