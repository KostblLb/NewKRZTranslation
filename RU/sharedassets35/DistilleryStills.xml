    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Look at the neck. Like a swan's, eh?</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">This design is part of our legacy. The vapor passes up through this neck along just such a contour so as to produce our bourbon's signature character.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Mr. Bishop always said the shape came to him in a dream. He shot awake in the middle of the night, and set to work hammering an old tea kettle to match that phantom geometry.</line>

    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Here, the vapors pass through a coil submerged in cold water, and condense.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Again, the geometry is very particular. Mr. Bishop arrived by intuition at a series of mathematical relationships between the angles and magnitudes here â€” some weird cacophony of ratios.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Well, those principles are lost to history now. Moving along!</line>
