    <line speaker="mimi">Is there any pie left in the break room?</line>
    <line speaker="jenn">Darryl finished it off before he went home last night.</line>
    <line speaker="mimi">Darryl is on thin ice.</line>
    <line speaker="jenn">You're declaring enemies left and right.</line>
    <line speaker="mimi">What? Who else?</line>
    <line speaker="jenn">That other Márquez woman: "Weaver." Didn't you ... Maybe I misunderstood. I thought I detected some, uh, `animosity`.</line>
    <line speaker="mimi">Oh, no, nothing like that. She wasn't the kind of person you could "like" or "dislike," really; she was just `there`, and all you could do was accept her. Like magnetism, or gravity.</line>

    <line speaker="mimi">Oh yeah, they're definitely different people. I just wonder if they're related or something. I never imagined Weaver having any family, but I guess everyone has `some` family, right?</line>
    <line speaker="jenn">`(Reading, distracted.)` What? Oh, sure, probably.</line>
