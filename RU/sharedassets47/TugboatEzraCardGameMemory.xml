    <line speaker="junebug">Sounds good on the `Mammoth`'s P.A.</line>
    <line speaker="cate">Yeah, that's the only way I listen to anything lately. Ha ha.</line>

    <line blocking="Dialog Look Cat Cate" speaker="cate">We're all too `soggy-brained`. I know I am. I even take homemade supplements for it: shade-grown lichen boiled with the peel of a lemon, then frozen and crushed with oak leaves. It's a scalp massage oil. You can smell it if I get close.</line>
    <line speaker="cate">It dries the brain out a bit, which is helpful for a good memory, if I can remember to use it often enough in the first place!</line>
    <line speaker="cate">Oh, don't worry, the `soggy` brain has its benefits, too. If your brain is soft and damp, new ideas can make a clear impression, like a boot in wet sand. But, like wet sand, it can easily get muddied and washed away. So there's a trade-off, see?</line>
    <line speaker="cate">It's a shame we can't have it both ways, isn't it?</line>
