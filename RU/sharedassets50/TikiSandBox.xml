    <line>Shannon finds a small box, about the right size for an injured baby bird or a couple of mice. This box is only full of sand. She rolls a few grains in her fingertips. It feels different from the sand under her toes: finer, and slicker. She has the feeling this is sand from a different beach.</line>
