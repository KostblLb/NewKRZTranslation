    <line speaker="johnny">`(To EZRA.)` Alright, claw maestro, let's give it another shot.</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">So, let's see what's on the top of the pile, here ... there's a stuffed octopus, a plastic bag full of clam shells, a cowboy hat, and some big headphones.</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">That octopus has a leg wrapped around the boombox underneath it. The shells are pretty clear, but I don't know if the claw can really grip the bag well. The cowboy hat is in the corner, so it's kind of tricky to tell if it's wedged in or not. Those headphones might be a good bet, but I can't see the cord; it could be wrapped around something.</line>
