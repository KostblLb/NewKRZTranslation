    <line speaker="will">... add a few of these really big caps with the slimy gills. I shouldn't say "slimy" ... moist.</line>

    <line speaker="will">I used to follow a recipe I learned from Ida herself; the best cook you're gonna meet on this river. Of course, it had a few secret ingredients; she has the good sense to preserve some mystery around her cooking. Better for business.</line>

    <line speaker="will">Not so easy ...</line>
