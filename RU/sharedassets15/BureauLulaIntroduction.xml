    <line speaker="letter">ATTN: Lula Chamberlain, RE: Your application.</line>
    <line speaker="letter">Thank you for your application to the `Gaston Trust for Imagined Architecture`'s annual fellowship. We received a record number of applications this year — over 100 in total — and regrettably we can award only one fellowship position per year. As you know, our review process includes a multiphase blind committee analysis of portfolio submissions, as well as a careful review by a panel of subject matter experts on each applicant's notability and relevance in the field.</line>
    <line speaker="letter">We must be extremely selective in our process so as to maintain the standards we have established over our thirty-five years in operation. Our panel did not select your application.</line>
    <line speaker="letter">We encourage you to consider re-applying next year. Many young artists and architects re-apply for a few successive years before being accepted.</line>
    <line speaker="letter">Sincerely, Dr. Karl Stone-Norden, Architect, Gaston Trust for Imagined Architecture</line>

    <line speaker="note">sorry for the condescending form letter. love your work. unfortunately, i just do the mail here.</line>
