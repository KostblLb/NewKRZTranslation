    <line>See that rough circle of rocky protrusions, near the shore? It's more intricate than it looks; more than two-thirds of it is actually underwater. I haven't seen it myself, but listen to this:</line>
    <line>It's man-made, and the rocks weren't placed according to their size, so what's visible is a more or less uniformly random selection of the overall shape. It looks like it might be a spiral, all told, or maybe some kind of meditative labyrinth.</line>
    <line>At the head of it is a petrified oak stump. That was moved here from above ground, of course, decades ago. That's where the ceremony took place.</line>
    <line>The Locke-Lucks were married here. Many frail-tongued observers said they should just go with "Locke" or "Luck," or split the difference with "Look," or even "Lick," or really anything else, but it was never going to happen.</line>

    <line>She was a volunteer teaching conflict mediation skills to guards, and he was employed at the side gate accepting deliveries and greeting visitors. Neither of them once saw a prisoner.</line>

    <line>They took a chemistry class together where she challenged him to "shoot the moon" â€” learning formulae and compounds well enough to answer every test question exactly wrong, and achieve a perfect failing grade.</line>

    <line>Their driver's license photographs were mixed up by the clerk, a mistake they discovered immediately but never corrected.</line>

    <line>Their engagement was welcome news for the family businesses, who had been looking for some opportunity to merge interests.</line>
    <option goto="newspaper">The Lockes ran a busy printing press, and the Lucks managed a fleet of bicycle couriers.</option>

    <line>The natural next step was to start a local paper, what would become `The Echo River Evening Record`.</line>

    <line>Surely someone in some branch of those two great trees had elephant husbandry on the brain. This is all speculation.</line>

  <scene name="wedding">
    <line>The ceremony itself was humble and perfunctory, and it must have somehow involved these rocks.</line>
    <option goto="closing">Maybe they walked around them in a spiral, like a symbol of their ever-tightening bond.</option>
    <option goto="closing">Probably the rocks marked the boundaries between the two families, Lucks on the inner loop and Lockes on the outer, or the other way around.</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="closing" nextScene="end">
    <line>And it must have also involved that petrified stump. Neither family is particularly religious, but rumors persist that the officiant wore a robe.</line>
