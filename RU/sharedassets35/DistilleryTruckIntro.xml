    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Here it is. Now, I have to ask, as a matter of course: what kind of experience do you have driving trucks?</line>
    <option goto="antiques" speaker="conway">I drove deliveries for an antique shop, up until this last run.</option>

    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">I suppose that's all you must say? I like that. Never say more than you must — it's boastful, and ugly.</line>

    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">I do pity ill-fated Miguel — he was good company, and slow to anger. But, if we're speaking confidentially ...</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Well, with all that lost `product` to be repaid — bourbon and glass dashed across the interstate, and a few casks too — we're all just thankful he had no ... next of kin.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">So. Let's see if we can ring up the dispatcher.</line>
