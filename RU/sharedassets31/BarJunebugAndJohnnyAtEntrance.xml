    <line speaker="junebug">It's like Cyrano Cole meets Ike Towner, but with a woman lead, and the keyboards are kind of ambient whisperwave.</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">Little bit more reverb.</line>

    <line speaker="junebug">We have a regular thing here. Harry likes to just book it all up and forget about it. He's not really a music lover, I wouldn't say, but I guess his wife was. She had this stage put in, I know that. So he keeps it going. In her memory or out of habit.</line>

    <line speaker="junebug">Gave it up, huh? Well I bet Harry has some coffee on back there, but I won't vouch for quality.</line>
