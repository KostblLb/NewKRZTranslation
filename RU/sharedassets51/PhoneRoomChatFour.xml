    <line speaker="clara">My sister, back home. She's very depressing to me this morning. My uncle Andrius is terminally ill and refusing visitors, and Nadia is making a stir about it.</line>
    <option goto="bother-clara" speaker="cate">It doesn't bother you that your uncle is refusing visitors?</option>
    <option goto="close-to-uncle" speaker="cate">I'm sorry to hear. Are you close?</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="bother-clara" nextScene="respect">
    <line speaker="clara">He's a bear of a man. Wild animals — it's what they do. When it's time to die, they wander off into the forest, alone.</line>
    <line speaker="clara">No, I said it wrong: they don't "wander." They make a pilgrimage.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="close-to-uncle" nextScene="respect">
    <line speaker="clara">Yes, but only recently. He lived abroad for most of my life. I only met him a few years ago. My sister is older, so she knew him as a child, too.</line>
    <line speaker="clara">So I think her respect for him is distorted by sentiment.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="respect">
    <line speaker="clara">We must always take the dying at their word. Their motivations are beyond our understanding.</line>
    <line speaker="clara">The older man — he's swimming back to the `Mammoth`? No emergency, I hope?</line>

    <option goto="conway-lazy" speaker="cate" condition="phone-room-shannon-conway-explanation=leg-pain">Best for him not to move around too much.</option>
    
    <option goto="conway-garlic" speaker="cate" condition="phone-room-shannon-conway-explanation=headache">You know, he `could` try some garlic. Miraculous.</option>
    <option goto="conway-caffeine" speaker="cate" condition="phone-room-shannon-conway-explanation=headache">Hm, maybe some caffeine would help his headache.</option>
    
    <option goto="conway-toilet" speaker="cate" condition="phone-room-shannon-conway-explanation=bathroom">He's looking for the toilet.</option>
    <option goto="conway-paper" speaker="cate" condition="phone-room-shannon-conway-explanation=bathroom">Oh, I hope there's paper ... it's been a busy night.</option>

    <line speaker="brandon">Hey, you folks are traveling with that old guy, right? With the leg? Is he OK?</line>
    <line speaker="brandon">I saw him earlier tonight. He came by the storage facility for some files. He totally `bit it` on the staircase!</line>
    <line speaker="brandon">He's OK though, right?</line>
    
    <option speaker="cate" goto="conway-is-passenger">I think so. I don't know him too well; he's a passenger.</option>
    <option speaker="cate" goto="conway-is-drunk">Sure, he's just been drinking a bit. You know how it is.</option>

  <scene name="conway-is-preoccupied" nextScene="closing">
    <line speaker="brandon">Yeah, I got that feeling, too. Back at the storage facility, he was asking a lot of weird questions. And he seemed distracted, like ... spiritually.</line>
