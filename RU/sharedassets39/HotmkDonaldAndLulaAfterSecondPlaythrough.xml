    <line speaker="lula">I've met a few of your former assistants. One can't help but hear things.</line>
    <line speaker="lula">So, this is what became of our project.</line>
    <line speaker="donald" event="donald-speaking">Oh ... I've made some additions. Joseph stole the data tapes for the first half, so I've had some blank spots to fill.</line>

    <line speaker="lula" event="lula-speaking">Good to ... good night, Donald.</line>
    <line speaker="lula">`(To SHANNON.)` Meet me at the Bureau, and we'll get you on your way. Head counter-clockwise to the cathode ray, then turn around. Then it's just clockwise until you find the Bureau.</line>
    <line speaker="lula">`(Quietly.)` Between us, I think `you` should drive.</line>
