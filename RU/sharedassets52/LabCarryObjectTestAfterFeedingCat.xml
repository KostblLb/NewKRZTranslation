    <line speaker="mimi">Wait ... I don't remember this test.</line>
    <line speaker="jenn">Oh.</line>

    <line speaker="jenn">No, this is just ... sometimes, if I can't make it in for a few days, I might leave a note to feed the cats.</line>
    <line speaker="mimi">For the test subjects? Wow. How do you know they'll do it?</line>

    <line speaker="mimi">Very well then, I contradict myself.</line>
