    <line speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">That damn sound! Those damn voices! I don't even know what direction I was running. I wove through that network of tunnels. I ran my hand along the wall, always turning left, but every turn and every rock felt the same. For all I knew, I was running in circles!</line>
    <line speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">Finally, I ended up here.</line>
    <line condition="xanadu-chased-searched" speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">And I hid ... I panicked. I heard you talking, but ... I didn't think I could trust my senses.</line>
    <line condition="xanadu-chased-wait-time=moment|xanadu-chased-wait-time=hour" speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">I heard you talking, but ... I didn't think I could trust my senses.</line>

    <line condition="xanadu-chased-wait-time=month" speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">Eventually, I must have fallen asleep. I heard you talking, but I didn't know what to trust. I ran away again, back into the tunnels, for ... I don't know how long. There's plenty of fresh water trickling through these caves. I kept alive with that and cave plants. I learned to enjoy the taste of bat. What an ugly appetite.</line>
    <line condition="xanadu-chased-wait-time=year" speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">When I heard you coming, I ran. I could only hear the echoes of your voices at first, and ... I didn't know what to trust! In the tunnels, I found a mess of strange things. Some of it I don't want to talk about, some of it I don't know how ... and on some of it I was sworn to secrecy!</line>
    <line speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">But, listen: there's one thing I have to tell you. While I was out there lost in the tunnels and caves, I came across the |Zero|, and ... I had no idea.</line>
    <line speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">It's like a real place: they pick up garbage, they deliver mail, they go to work and to church ... but it has an awful kind of emptiness.</line>
    <line speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">Wandering through, I heard horrible echoes. Weird images got burned in my mind's eye:</line>
    <line speaker="joseph" style="xanadu">A television, a scarecrow, a crystal, a feather, a sandwich ... a CRT monitor, a bottle ... an anchor ...</line>
