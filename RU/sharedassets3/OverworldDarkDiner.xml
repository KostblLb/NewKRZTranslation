      The diner doesn't appear to have a name. A vinyl banner slung above the door simply reads: &quot;24 Hours.&quot; It only has one window, behind which the blinds are tightly closed.

      The door swings open easily. A bell rings nearby. The interior of the diner is pitch black.

      A bit of errant light from the nearby highway creeps through the open door, and gradually Conway is able to make out a few figures inside:

      Someone shines a flashlight in Conway's eyes. The light is almost immediately blinding, but in the instant it switches on he can make out a few figures inside:

    <line>Two old men in trucker hats sit in a corner booth, with a checkers board set on the table between them.</line>

      He hits his knee on something hard and metallic, winces quietly, and then carefully finds his way to a stool. He places his hand on the counter.

    <line>
      Another hand, a young woman's, rests itself on his. She guides his fingers to a laminated menu. Conway closes his eyes, opens them, maybe closes them again. Impossible to differentiate.

    <line>
      A cup of coffee would do it. Black ... oily, even. Hot, familiar diner coffee. Conway runs his hand down the menu. The surface is uniformly flat, and slick with condensation.

  <scene name="order-waffles" nextScene="waitress">
    <line>
      Waffles are a safe bet even at some darkened hole-in-the-wall. Conway squints hopelessly at the menu, searching in the dark for some legible text.

      The Wildcats are struggling, but today's was an important game. They could have rallied. Perhaps the waitress heard the game from the kitchen; or maybe she's a fan herself. Conway clears his throat.

      He feels a warm hand against his cheek, and freezes. Her fingers run across the stubble of his chin. He feels like apologizing. She leans forward, and so does he â€”
