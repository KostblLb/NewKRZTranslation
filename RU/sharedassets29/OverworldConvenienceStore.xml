    <line>The convenience store is just a tiny booth in the middle of a lot that must have once been an active gas station. Disused pumps chip red paint into dull brown and white stains.</line>

    <line>The inside of the booth is big enough for a card table, two chairs, and a few plastic crates filled with snacks and warm coke. Two men shuffle plastic dominoes across the table.</line>

    <line>He finds a sliding service window on the far side of the booth. It's the kind of service window that can slide in and out of the booth without allowing anyone to reach in and make a grab for the cash register.</line>

  <scene name="add-money" nextScene="end">
    <line>One of the men lets out a vexed sigh. Without standing, or turning his eyes away from the game, he reaches into a plastic crate and retrieves a small blue bag, distractedly pushing it through the service window.</line>
    <line>Chips, or ... something? The bag is illustrated with a cartoon drawing of an avocado, but the nutritional data suggests it's pretty sugary. The expiration date has been worn away.</line>
