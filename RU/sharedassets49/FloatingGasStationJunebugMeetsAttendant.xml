    <line speaker="attendant">What kind?</line>

  <scene name="assume-crystals" nextScene="boat">
    <setGameVar name="floating-gas-station-junebug-errand" value="crystals" />
    <line speaker="attendant">We've got them on sale. All kinds of folks come in here looking for crystals. There's a few over there with milky white shocks through the middle, like you caught a piece of a cloud. People seem to like those a lot.</line>
    <line speaker="attendant">Yep ...</line>
    <line speaker="attendant">Popular crystals.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="coffee" nextScene="boat">
    <line speaker="attendant">It's back here, but I'm going to tell you something — it's been sitting on this burner for ... all night, I think. It was brewed by my predecessor.</line>
    <line speaker="attendant">You've got to be a particular kind of self-loathing-thirsty to drink this coffee. Or maybe it comforts you just to hold the cup in your hand. It's hot, at least.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="snacks" nextScene="boat">
    <line speaker="attendant">Sure, we have snacks. We have ... how about some jerky? It's "homemade." Not by me.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="boat">
    <line speaker="attendant">You work on the `Mammoth`? I can add it to your tab.</line>

  </scene>

  <scene name="recognize-boat">
    <line speaker="attendant">Sure, they're here every night ...</line>
    <line speaker="attendant">It's OK. I have one of those faces. `Forgettable`.</line>
    <option goto="not-forgettable" speaker="junebug">I wouldn't say that ...</option>
    <option goto="dignity" speaker="junebug">Does it bother you?</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="not-forgettable" nextScene="dignity">
    <line speaker="attendant">It's OK. I've learned to accept it. In fact ...</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="passenger" nextScene="dignity">
    <line speaker="attendant">Sure, I should have guessed. You have the posture of someone on their way to somewhere. I have it, too. I just stand here behind the counter, and nobody affords me any greater importance than a spiderweb brushed out of the way.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="dignity">
    <line speaker="attendant">I've learned to cherish it. There's dignity in being forgotten, letting the crowd flow around you unspoiled.</line>
    <line speaker="attendant">I used to live in a city — I mean a `real` city. Cleveland, Ohio. I had some family money then, and I didn't have to work. I lived in hotels. In daylight, I walked wherever the people were. My only duty was to the crowd — I was its observer, its historian, its detective, its poet.</line>
    <line speaker="attendant">Well, the money ran out, and I dispersed with the rest of them. I took my duties with me here, to Lake Lethe and the Echo River. I live behind this counter, anonymous, invisible, but I live with dignity.</line>
    <line speaker="attendant">And yourself?</line>
    <option goto="junebug-flaneur" speaker="junebug">Sure, something like that.</option>
    <option goto="junebug-different" speaker="junebug">No, I don't think so.</option>

    <option goto="junebug-strangers" speaker="junebug">I enjoy the company of strangers.</option>

    <setGameVar name="floating-gas-station-junebug-flaneur-characterization" value="keep-moving" />    
    <line speaker="attendant">Yeah, that's the way to do it. I can't help it, myself — I travel at the pleasure of the current.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="junebug-different">
    <option goto="junebug-dont-blend-in" speaker="junebug">I don't blend in.</option>

  </scene>

    <setGameVar name="floating-gas-station-junebug-flaneur-characterization" value="not-alone" />    
    <line speaker="attendant">Sure, so you say. I say you can travel in company and still be alone ...</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="sendoff" nextScene="end">
    <line speaker="attendant" condition="floating-gas-station-junebug-errand=snacks">Snacks are in the back there.</line>
    <line speaker="attendant" condition="floating-gas-station-junebug-errand=coffee">Coffee and sugar are just around the counter here.</line>
