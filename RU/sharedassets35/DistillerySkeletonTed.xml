    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Ted met one of our engineers at a bar some years ago, and they just `clicked`.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Our engineer told him about some trouble with the equipment here, and he felt compelled to take a crack at it.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Ted's been obsessively tuning, replacing, and upgrading ever since. Quite a project, Ted! You'll get ahead of it one day, I'm sure.</line>
