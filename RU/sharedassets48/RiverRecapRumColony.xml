    <option goto="conway">I heard the old man went a little deeper in his cups.</option>
    <option goto="ezra">Ezra told me about the dark corners.</option>
    <option goto="junebug">Junebug missed an appointment, but didn't seem perturbed.</option>

    <option goto="run-in-dark">He said he liked to run in the dark.</option>
    <option goto="treasure">He said he found a treasure.</option>

    <line>I'm sure those two were more eager to listen to the house band — I can't remember exactly who was playing, but Patch always has someone in to tranquilize the crowd ...</line>
