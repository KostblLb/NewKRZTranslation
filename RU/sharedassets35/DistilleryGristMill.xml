    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Eh? Oh, The Formula! Changed our lives.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Once, years ago, we were as prisoners to the intricacies of our debts here. We'd have to account for everything on paper.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Compounding interest by hand, reassessing amortization and leveraged asset distributions according to nightly merit decay ...</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Then, `she` stepped out of the dark caves, to show us the light of The Formula! She had a brilliant grasp of mathematics, and a saintlike way of speaking right `through` the numbers.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Now, we just plug our daily numbers into The Formula, and run it all through the adding machine. We occasionally suffer some surplus drift, but she instructed us on all the necessary adjustments.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">It was devastating to see our revered mathematician go, but she was needed elsewhere. Her legacy abides.</line>
