    <line speaker="shannon">I guess so. Looks like they finally drained it. Or maybe it just drained off on its own.</line>

  <scene name="how-flood" nextScene="flood-description">
    <line speaker="shannon">Some careless miner or some unattended machine bored through into an underground lake.</line>

    <line speaker="shannon">The water came in pretty fast, and a lot of folks got trapped in the tunnels. I only heard parts of how it went from there — sanitized for the bereaved ... you know how these big companies are.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">But there was gossip too. The trapped miners couldn't get the pumps going because the power was rationed, so they shut all the lights off. But even then it wasn't enough.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">So I guess it was dark, when they ...</line>

    <line speaker="shannon">It doesn't matter now. Look, this old turntable is still wired up. The controls are dead but I can use my signal generator to switch tracks, if the water hasn't damaged it too much. Or we can just keep heading down this tunnel.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">All this junk hanging up around the turntable is from the company store. Just junk, you know? The miners would buy it and use it to decorate the place ... or as landmarks, I guess. Hard to know which way is which down here. It's all so dim and gray.</line>
