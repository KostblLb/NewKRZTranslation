    <line speaker="amy">`(To SHANNON.)` You're here to steal back the love of a boy you once knew, when you were too young to recognize the movements of the heart ...</line>
    <line speaker="amy">`(To CONWAY.)` And you're escorting her, pretending to have her interests at heart while really ...</line>
    <line speaker="amy">`(To JUNEBUG.)` ... really, you're in love with the young woman as well, and so you've agreed to help him conspire to win her affections, but it's just a ploy to set him up for embarrassment, and diminish him out of the picture!</line>

    <line speaker="amy">I used to be really good at this! I had eleven novels published, from &quot;The Billionaire's Bidding&quot; to &quot;Fields of Longing.&quot; Real hot, bodice-ripping stuff, you know? I miss those days in my Lexington studio apartment â€” just me and my thesaurus, steaming up the windows ...</line>

    <line speaker="amy">You know, suddenly it was all computers everywhere you went. I thought I might be able to do something with that. Inject a little libido into those ugly beige boxes. Ha! So I went back to the university and I studied human-computer interaction, and then I picked up Donald's research assistantship here, as a tester. Debugging.</line>
    <line speaker="amy">In my off-hours, I played around with the doomed love story at the core of our little simulation. That seemed to amuse Donald, so I kept at it ... I'm afraid I tinkered too much, made it too complex. Now our work is never done. We don't even have to add any new functionality: the bugs just grow on their own. Too complex.</line>
