    <line speaker="shannon">Well, I'll try not to get too far ahead of you. You don't mind my hitching a ride, do you? I kinda got a lift out here, and wasn't sure if, uh â€” when I'd be heading back. I can drive.</line>

    <line speaker="shannon">Well, it's like I told you: Weaver doesn't lie. If she sent you here to find your onramp, this is where you should be looking. Or maybe you just weren't listening closely enough, and that's not exactly what she said?</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="dogwood" nextScene="find-weaver">
    <line speaker="shannon">Yeah, alright. Well, maybe asking Weaver about the |Zero| was the wrong place to start. Maybe we should just ask her for specific directions. Her answers are complicated enough without a layer of indirection at the question.</line>

    <line speaker="shannon">I saw Weaver at my workshop. That's up north by Lake Nolin, right at Wax and Peonia, in the back of a bait shop. Pretty glamorous, right? These are the times we live in.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">She's either up there or back at the farmhouse. Whichever you want to head to first, just let me know.</line>
