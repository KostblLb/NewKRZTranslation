    <line speaker="luis">`(Yelling.)` The water is fine! Invigorating. It makes me want to run. I could gallop up and down this beach like a horse!</line>
    <line speaker="clerk böhm">`(To METZSTEIN.)` What's he yelling about?</line>
    <line speaker="clerk metzstein">He wants to run on the beach. Like a horse, he says.</line>

    <line speaker="clerk böhm">Well? Tell her about it!</line>
    <line speaker="clerk metzstein">But I don't know anything more than you do. It wasn't part of my caseload.</line>

    <line speaker="clerk böhm">Poor Rick. He's a lightweight.</line>
    <line speaker="clerk metzstein">I think he just drank too fast. It's easy to get carried away. Oh, he always gets so `melancholy` when he drinks.</line>
    <line speaker="clerk metzstein">Remember? The office picnic at that big, flat rock ...</line>
    <line speaker="clerk böhm">Oh, I remember. He was talking Lula's ear off. She slipped away, and he sat on the ground, nursing that brown bottle, crying! Sobbing about "the days that are no more."</line>
