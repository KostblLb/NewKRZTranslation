    <line>Conway leaves the truck to stretch his legs by the creek. He follows the edge of the road, then wanders a bit into the woods where the creek and road part.</line>
    <line>The creek bed is nearly dry this time of year, but a few thin channels still run through the rocks.</line>
    <line>He can barely make out the moonlit silhouette of an overturned boat, a few dozen yards down the creek. He reaches habitually into his jacket pocket, then remembers he doesn't carry a flask anymore.</line>
