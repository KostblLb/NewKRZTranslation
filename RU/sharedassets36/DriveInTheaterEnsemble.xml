    <line speaker="junebug">Sure, most of them are. But first everyone gets in a crisis, and that makes it more satisfying.</line>

    <line speaker="junebug">I manage.</line>

    <line speaker="junebug">It's in their posture. See how the big one is all slumped there? If they were just introducing him, they'd want him to look tall and powerful. Now you see him worn down to almost nothing.</line>

    <line speaker="junebug">The car speakers are my favorite part. You know they use radio? Just regular radio, I mean. Sometimes people bring a little transmitter in and jam the signal with some circus music or something.</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">Something loud and garish, that's what makes the best jamming signal. Hit all the frequencies. Ha!</line>

    <line speaker="shannon">No? That's funny, you seem like the type ... sitting in a theater watching some old cowboy movie ... big old bag of popcorn. Ha ha.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">For what it's worth, I don't know much about movies either. I like TV ...</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">You know the difference between film and TV? A film is projected light that gets bounced off a screen. You see the reflection. With a TV, you look straight at the light.</line>
