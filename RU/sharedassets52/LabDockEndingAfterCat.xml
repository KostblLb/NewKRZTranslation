    <line speaker="jenn">This has been a bit of a memory trip for you, huh? I bet you didn't expect these old tapes to stir up so much ... How does it feel for these people to come up again, Weaver MÃ¡rquez and Wise Will, I mean, and ... what was your boyfriend's name? The one who died in college.</line>
    <line speaker="mimi">Charlie. Yeah, it's kind of a bittersweet experience, actually. Like looking at photographs of people who've died, or moved away. People that are gone.</line>
    <line speaker="jenn">Gone, but not forgotten.</line>
    <line speaker="mimi">No, not forgotten. You're right.</line>
