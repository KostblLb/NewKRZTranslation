    <line speaker="conway">It's just that thing about ... what was it ... when you walk through a door?</line>
    <line speaker="conway">When you go into the kitchen for something, and as soon as you pass from one room into another, you forget what you wanted.</line>
    <line speaker="conway">You have to walk back out just to remember! Like you left a part of your brain behind. Hey, I wonder if I could follow that brain-crumb trail all the way back to the room I was born in ...</line>

    <line speaker="conway">Fifteen months, this last time. I think I hung on because I knew there wouldn't for much longer be anywhere to go back to. She went to live with her sister, now, and ... she probably won't remember me for long, anyway.</line>
    <line speaker="conway">One time she picked me up out of a ditch by the road, blackout drunk at dawn. I came around later that night. She'd taken care of me. I told her I didn't deserve it, and she said I didn't have to deserve it.</line>
