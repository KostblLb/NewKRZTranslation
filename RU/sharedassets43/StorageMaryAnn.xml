  <scene name="ezra-bold" nextScene="oils">
    <line speaker="mary ann">Just clearing my head. Turpentine is good for that. Clears the sinuses, and the cobwebs.</line>

    <line speaker="shannon">Ha. I guess he's feeling shy. Is that oil paint?</line>

    <line speaker="mary ann">I can only do watercolors at home â€” my apartment is carpeted, and the landlord's paranoid it'll soak up the fumes.</line>
    <line speaker="mary ann">But these storage spaces are pretty cheap, and the ventilation is good. So I can play with oil paints here. Cheaper than a studio.</line>
    <option goto="subject" speaker="ezra">What are you painting?</option>
    <option goto="fumes" speaker="ezra">It smells dangerous.</option>
    <option goto="sculpture" speaker="ezra">Me and Julian built a rock sculpture by the lake.</option>
