    <line speaker="rick">Oh, no, she's much too busy. Let's get some of our junior clerks to sort your paperwork first, so we don't waste any of Ms. Chamberlain's time.</line>

    <line speaker="rick">It's a pretty straightforward process. First, you'll need to get a case number assigned. Talk to Clerk Metzstein about that. She's just over there at the end of the room.</line>
    <line speaker="rick">Happy to help!</line>
