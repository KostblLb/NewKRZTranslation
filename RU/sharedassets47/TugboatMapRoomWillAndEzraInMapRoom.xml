    <line speaker="will">Salutations, small man.</line>
    <line speaker="will">Cate says you have an adjustment for our charts. Good timing; I'm just checking my copies.</line>
    <line speaker="will">That's how we keep our charts up to date: as we pass through a section of the river or the lake, I draw a new copy of the map and make adjustments for anything we see that doesn't match.</line>

    <line>`(WILL points to a small drawing on the map.)`</line>
    <line speaker="will" blocking="@WillPoints">So, this is where we have Dinosaur Rock marked now. This little dinosaur drawing. I drew that.</line>

    <option speaker="ezra" goto="cool-claws">Cool claws.</option>
    <option speaker="ezra" goto="what-kind-of-dinosaur">What kind of dinosaur is it?</option>

    <line speaker="will">Thank you.</line>

    <line blocking="@WillPoints">`(WILL points to another small drawing on the map.)`</line>
    <line speaker="will">And this here is where we thought <variable name="tugboat-ezra-landmark" /> was. But now I guess we've got to move it back a bit ...</line>
    
    <line speaker="will">But how far? I wonder ... Any ideas? Anything else you remember about when you saw <variable name="tugboat-ezra-landmark" />?</line>

    <option speaker="ezra" goto="location-lake-dark">The water got really dark for a little bit.</option>
    <option speaker="ezra" goto="location-other-boat">There was another boat we passed around <variable name="tugboat-ezra-landmark" /> — a sailboat with a painting of a fish on the sail.</option>
    <option speaker="ezra" goto="location-clock">I saw the clock — we passed <variable name="tugboat-ezra-landmark" /> six minutes before Dinosaur Rock.</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="location-lake-dark" nextScene="clutter">
    <line speaker="will" blocking="@WillPoints">Aha! Well, that'd put <variable name="tugboat-ezra-landmark" /> somewhere in ... `here`. That's the only part of the chart before Dinosaur Rock where the lake "deepens" noticeably. Good work!</line>
  </scene>
  
  <scene name="location-other-boat" nextScene="clutter">
    <line speaker="will">Aha — that must have been Mary Kennedy out fishing. She usually anchors right around ... here. But you didn't hear that from me; she's `very` protective of her good fishing spots.</line>
  </scene>
  
  <scene name="location-clock" nextScene="clutter">
    <line speaker="will">That'll do just fine! So, let's see, at our current speed that would give us a distance of ... oh, about an eighth of a mile, let's say.</line>
    <line>`(WILL measures along the charted lake with a divider.)`</line>
    <line speaker="will">Somewhere around `here`. Good enough, eh?</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="clutter">
    <line speaker="will">That should do it for the new copy. Oh, I made some other corrections: tucked in the banks a little, made this section deeper, and left off a shipwreck that must have washed away or been scavenged into splinters.</line>
    <line speaker="will">Of course, it means a lot of clutter; all these old copies.</line>
    <line speaker="will">Say —</line>
    <line>`(WILL gestures to a pile of old maps.)`</line>
    <line speaker="will">I was just about to throw this stack out. Maybe you'd like to hang onto one? They're out of date, but they could be fun to look at. These are mostly river charts, I think. Take a look through and see if one of them catches your eye.</line>
