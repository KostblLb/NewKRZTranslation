    <line>A faux-rustic wooden sign hangs by chain above the door: &quot;Glasgow Clockworks,&quot; carved in a fanciful typeface, then set with what looks like brass or colored plastic. The windows are darkened, too crowded with antique clocks to make out the interior.</line>
    <line>A small metal sign bolted in the building's alley reads &quot;GTS Stop #5. 5:30 — 7:15 — 8:45 — 10:15 — 12:15 — ,&quot; and then several more numbers or words, worn illegible by rain.</line>
    
    <line condition="!overworld-bus-stop-picked-up-anyone">Three people stand under the sign: a young man with a newspaper, a young woman scribbling anxiously in a leather-bound journal, and an older woman whose face is shadowed by a wide-brimmed hat.</line>

    <line>Conway rests his head against the window and closes his eyes. It feels cool. His breath fogs the glass like September.</line>
    <line>It was fall when he met Lysette. School days. Neither of them were very good students. They'd cut out early and spend the afternoons in darkened bars.</line>
    <line>Sometimes she'd sing, or he'd pick up bottles, and the staff would pretend they were old enough to be there. Conway and Lysette would pretend, too.</line>
    <line>Then he got a long haul job, lost it on the road, and took too long coming home. He took a job from a wiry, irritable roofer named Ira.</line>
    <line>Ira brought him home to meet the wife and son, and there she was. Conway kept his mouth shut, not out of respect but out of habit.</line>
