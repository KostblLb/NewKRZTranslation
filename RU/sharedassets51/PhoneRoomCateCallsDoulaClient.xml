    <line speaker="summer">No, I can't really get comfortable enough to sleep anymore, except in the car. Oh, not driving! In the passenger's seat, reclined. Eric drove me around the reservoir this afternoon and I got an hour or two in.</line>

    <line speaker="summer">Hey, Cate, I really appreciate you checking in. I have your pager number, and so does Eric, just in case I'm too, um, distracted or whatever.</line>
