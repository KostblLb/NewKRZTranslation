    <line speaker="conway">Better hang on a minute, it feels like there's one kind of `hovering` right over me ...</line>
    
    <line speaker="conway" condition="three:lysettes-kitchen-charlie-studied=aviation">They don't really hover though, do they? I mean, how could they ... I guess a hummingbird will hover by beating its wings really fast, maybe they can do that too.</line>
    <line speaker="conway" condition="three:lysettes-kitchen-charlie-studied=aviation">I used to watch hummingbirds in the afternoon, at the kitchen window. Lysette's kid Charlie, he loved them — you know, he studied aviation ... He set up a bunch of hummingbird feeders that last summer he was home. Big sugar-water buffet! But those dumb birds didn't find it until he was gone.</line>
    <line speaker="conway" condition="three:lysettes-kitchen-charlie-studied=aviation">Anyway, me and Lys, sometimes we'd try to see one of them up close. You get up to the window and then you have to stand totally still for a while, like one of those wax sculptures, don't even move your eyes, like `this` ...</line>
    <line speaker="conway" condition="three:lysettes-kitchen-charlie-studied=aviation">Oh, you can't see me. Ha ha. I was doing the "watching hummingbirds close-up" face.</line>

    <line speaker="conway" condition="three:lysettes-kitchen-charlie-studied=astronomy">They don't really hover though, do they? I mean how could they ... I guess a lightning bug will hover by beating its wings really fast, maybe they can do that too.</line>
    <line speaker="conway" condition="three:lysettes-kitchen-charlie-studied=astronomy">I used to watch lightning bugs in the evening, out at the edge of the woods. Lysette's kid Charlie, he loved them — you know, he ended up going to college and studying astronomy, and I like to think he got his love for stars from those nights watching bugs.</line>
    <line speaker="conway" condition="three:lysettes-kitchen-charlie-studied=astronomy">Anyway, me and Charlie, sometimes we'd try to see one of them up close — you lay in the grass and you have to be totally still for a while, like one of those wax sculptures, don't even breathe, like `this` ...</line>
