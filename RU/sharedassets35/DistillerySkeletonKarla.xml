    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">You still here, Karla? I thought your shift was over hours ago ...</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Karla joined us as a contractor, upgrading the aging racks in the warehouse.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Of course we can't just `empty` the warehouse to replace the wood all at once, so she's reconstructing the latticework lockstep with our aging schedule.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">She does a little extra carpentry for us here and there, just to cover the fees.</line>
    <line speaker="doolittle" style="skeleton">Keeping ahead of your self-employment taxes at least, Karla? Sometimes it's all we can do.</line>
