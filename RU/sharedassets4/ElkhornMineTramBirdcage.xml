    <line>A paper tag hangs from the birdcage by a string: &quot;*CANARY 25 TOKENS*.&quot;</line>
    <line>Canaries sold at the company store? Did they also sell respirators? No bones in the cage. The bird must have been set free. Or maybe the cage was cleaned.</line>
    <line>There are cardinals at the Louisville Zoo. And other birds: ostriches, eagles ... emus ... no canaries. Too common? Too small, maybe. But they have starlings. Starlings aren't much bigger than canaries.</line>
