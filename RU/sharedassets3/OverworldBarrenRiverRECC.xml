    <line pause="false">The exterior of the `Barren River Rural Electric Cooperative Corporation` is a dingy beige, sprinkled with fading graffiti. The front door hangs open from a broken hinge. The windows are dark.</line>

    <line>The room feels empty with no furniture other than the built-in front desk, host to a disconnected telephone and a few empty beer cans. Meandering lines of color have been spray-painted along the walls.</line>
    <line pause="false">Behind the desk, a hallway leads into darkness.</line>

  <scene name="hallway">
    <line>The hallway passes several smaller office doors. It quickly disappears into darkness. Something is glowing in the distance, barely.</line>

    <line>One of the office doors is still locked. Another has been broken open, the door handle bent awkwardly inwards and embedded in the wood, but it's jammed against a filing cabinet. On closer inspection through the crack in the door, the whole room is filled with filing cabinets and other disused furniture.</line>

  <scene name="dark-end-of-hallway">
    <line>The door at the far end of the hallway is tightly closed, but a warm glow bleeds in from its edges.</line>

    <line>The handle is loose, and the door swings open easily. The hallway fills with warmth, light, and the smells of smoke and coffee.</line>

    <line>About a dozen men and women sit around a campfire in the middle of a large room. Cubicle walls have been cut into pieces: some leaning up against the walls, and some arranged into stacks of firewood.</line>
    <line>One of the women waves to Conway, and offers him an empty chair. It's missing wheels, but it's comfortable and easily adjustable to his height. Someone takes a pot hung above the fire and pours coffee into a styrofoam cup. Conway accepts it, and they all return to watching the fire.</line>
