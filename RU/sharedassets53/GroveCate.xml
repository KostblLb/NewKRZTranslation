    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-ezra-took-cordyceps">Is this a caterpillar? Oh, I see ... Did you get a look at this black thread coming out of his head? That's actually a fungus. It grows in the caterpillar, eats it from the inside out, even changes its behavior a bit!</line>

    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-ezra-took-sheeps-head">Aha! Brown gold. Most people call these "sheep's head," but in alternative medicine circles it's better known by its Japanese name: "maitake," the dancing mushroom. Apt, because you do a happy little dance when you find one.</line>
    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-ezra-took-sheeps-head">It fights cancer, supports the immune system, regulates blood sugar, and tastes like eggplant. This one's a bit old and tough, but it's nothing that can't be solved with a lot of butter.</line>

    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-ezra-took-puffball">A blue puffball ... interesting. I don't think I've seen this `exact` species before. This one's too old to be of any use, anyway.

    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-ezra-took-puffball">— and the wind does the rest. See, it's `weakness` as a survival strategy. A kind of radical, transformative weakness.</line>

    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-bitter-hedgehog">OK, this one is called "Bitter Hedgehog," and it's on my list. It's great for nausea, which is basically the number one complaint of the pregnant women I treat.</line>
    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-bitter-hedgehog">It tastes kind of like black pepper ... It's `OK`. I let it dry out so it's really tough, and they just chew on it like bubble gum.</line>

    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-false-morel">This one I can't really use, but I picked it just to show it to you. It looks a lot like a very popular eating mushroom around these parts, called a "morel." But it's not a morel.</line>

    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-false-morel">This is the easiest way to tell them apart. The real morel is empty. `This` one, the "false morel," is actually kind of poisonous!</line>

    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-shoelace">These ones are really cool. See how they kind of glow a little?</line>
    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-shoelace">It's not enough to find your way in the dark or anything, but still pretty amazing.</line>
    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-shoelace">Anyway, I make a tea out of them; pretty good for headaches.</line>
    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-shoelace">`(CATE puts the mushrooms back into her bag.)`</line>

    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-bat-egg">`(CATE takes the speckled white ball out of her bag.)`</line>
    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-bat-egg">These are called "bat eggs." See this gooey black stuff leaking out the side here? I guess somebody somewhere once thought this stuff looked like egg yolk, and it's black, like a bat ...</line>
    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-bat-egg">I mean — I'm kind of speculating. I don't `really` know why they're called "bat eggs."</line>
    <line speaker="cate" condition="grove-cate-took-bat-egg">They're not good for anything, really, and they'll give you bad stomach ache if you try to eat them. I just wanted to show it to you.</line>

    <line speaker="cate">I guess they had boats full of soldiers and supplies going up and down the Ohio River. And they fought on the river, like, boat-to-boat, with cannons or something, I guess. Machine guns?</line>
    <line speaker="cate">I'm no military historian, as you can probably tell. Ha ha.</line>
    <line speaker="cate">Anyway, I guess this one just got lost, and somehow ended up all the way down here. Maybe it slipped into a cave up north; they're all connected, underground.</line>
    <line speaker="cate">There's another version of the story where it didn't get lost — it was full of deserters. They came down here to hide. Maybe that's why it's a "Pariah."</line>

    <fragment name="hotdog-guy-2b">She said she'd never heard of any of those things. He fished a stray hot dog out of the pickle jar.</fragment>    
    <fragment name="hotdog-guy-3">Was she at the hospital because of `that`? He meant the cigarette. Was she visiting family? Was she vegetarian? That last one was all business; he had some veggie dogs in a separate tray at the bottom of the cart.</fragment>
