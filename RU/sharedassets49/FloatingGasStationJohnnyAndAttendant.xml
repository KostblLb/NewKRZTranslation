    <line speaker="attendant">I had three boxes at the beginning of this week, and they're all gone. Can't keep them on the shelves.</line>

    <line speaker="attendant">I'm out. I figured that pot would last the rest of the night, at least.</line>

  <scene name="crystal-question" nextScene="low-stock">
    <line speaker="attendant">There used to be a young man who came by here and traded them for gas. He's a diver; I guess he found them diving. Haven't seen him in a while, though. That right there could be the last of them.</line>

    <line speaker="attendant">To be honest, our whole inventory is pretty low right now. There's a delivery boat that usually swings by earlier in the night, but I guess something came up.</line>

    <line speaker="attendant">OK. Yeah, I had a feeling you two might be traveling together.</line>

  <scene name="live-nearby" nextScene="bye">
    <line speaker="attendant">I live here. There's a cot in the back — nobody ever notices it. Not that I do much sleeping, really, but sometimes I lay on it anyway just to keep it in shape.</line>

    <line speaker="attendant">I wouldn't say I meet them, but I do sell them gas.</line>
