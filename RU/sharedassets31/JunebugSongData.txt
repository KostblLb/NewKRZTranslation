                           When you left me
                      my heart was broke in two,
                         but I patched it up
                  and promised I would wait for you.

                     _I never should have met you
                          on that awful day.
             I was happy then, until you stole my heart,
                        and disappeared again.

                    before I ever learned to cry.
                    When someone loved me briefly,
                        and then said goodbye.
