He worked in a factory, operating a delicate machine that required years of specialized training, so we focused on coordination and getting his left hand up to the speed and accuracy required for the work.</line>
    <line speaker="$lab-phone-voice-description" style="skeleton">I'll tell you what, after a couple weeks he was writing, throwing darts, you name it — all left-handed. A triumph of physical therapy. Back to work!</line>
    <line speaker="$lab-phone-voice-description" style="skeleton">The next day, he was unemployed.</line>
    <line speaker="$lab-phone-voice-description" style="skeleton">Seems he sat in front of that delicate machine, reached out with his left hand, and just froze. Had no idea what to do with the thing. Next time he was in my office, he said to me, "Doc, when I lost that hand, all my memory of working that machine went along with it."</line>
    <line speaker="$lab-phone-voice-description" style="skeleton">He said, "I'll tell you what, Doc, if I ever learn a trade again, I'll learn it in my gut. I won't ever again put something so precious as a memory in a place so vulnerable as a hand."</line>
    <line speaker="$lab-phone-voice-description" style="skeleton">Well, my coffee's done brewing. I'll let you go!</line>
