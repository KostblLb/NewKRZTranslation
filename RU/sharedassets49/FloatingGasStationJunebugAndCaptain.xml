    <line speaker="norm">`(To ATTENDANT.)` Shit, that floodwater washed you halfway up out to sea — I was looking for you down by New Königsberg same as usual but ain't nobody there, and the river's deep as an elephant's —</line>
    <line speaker="norm">`(Noticing JUNEBUG.)` Oh, didn't see you there, ma'am — pardon my language.</line>
    <option goto="elephant" speaker="junebug">What, "elephant?"</option>
    <option goto="headed" speaker="junebug">Where are you headed?</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="elephant" nextScene="loretta">
    <line speaker="norm">Ha ha. Alright, you're no paper flower, I see that.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="headed" nextScene="loretta">
    <line speaker="norm">Well, in fact, I'm headed right here — glad to have found it at last!</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="loretta">
    <line speaker="norm">`(Extending his hand, warmly.)` I expect you must be Loretta. Enchanted to meet you, sorry I'm late ... hey, is that coming on too flowery or something? "Enchanted?" Repeating it now, I feel a little silly ...</line>
    <option goto="enchanted-fine" speaker="junebug">I'm not Loretta, but I think you'll do fine with 'enchanted.'</option>
    <option goto="enchanted-old-fashioned" speaker="junebug">'Enchanted' sounds pretty old-fashioned — is that the kind of gal Loretta is?</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="enchanted-fine" nextScene="not-loretta">
    <line speaker="norm">Well, thanks for saying so!</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="enchanted-old-fashioned" nextScene="not-loretta">
    <line speaker="norm">Hm. I guess I don't know.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="not-loretta">
    <line speaker="norm">But now I'm double-embarrassed.</line>
    <option goto="how-do-you-know" speaker="junebug">How do you know Loretta?</option>
    <option goto="look-like-loretta" speaker="junebug">Do I look like her?</option>
    <option goto="funny-place" speaker="junebug">You picked a funny place to meet.</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="how-do-you-know" nextScene="computer-love">
    <line speaker="norm">I really don't!</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="look-like-loretta" nextScene="computer-love">
    <line speaker="norm">To be truthful, I couldn't tell you!</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="funny-place" nextScene="computer-love">
    <line speaker="norm">You're probably right about that. I guess I thought it'd be like "neutral territory," and we both live on the river ... it's not very romantic though, is it?</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="computer-love">
    <line speaker="norm">I met Loretta on the computer. We met each other there, I mean. Or, I guess, we spoke through the computer, and agreed to meet? I don't know the terminology ... I haven't dated in quite a while. Back when I met Greta — that's my wife, excuse me, my "ex," or maybe `I` am `her` ex? I don't know how to say it ...</line>
    <line speaker="norm">Anyway, back then there wasn't even such a thing as computers at all! I mean, I guess there probably was, but I never heard of one. I worked in textiles.</line>
    <line speaker="norm">So, here I am.</line>
    
    <option goto="wife" speaker="junebug">Didn't work out with Greta?</option>
    <option goto="date-plan" speaker="junebug">So what's your plan, when Loretta shows up?</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="wife" nextScene="missed-her">
    <line speaker="norm">She left me! I'm sure I can't blame her. Ha ha.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="date-plan" nextScene="missed-her">
    <line speaker="norm">Oh, maybe head down to The Rum Colony. Shoot, I forgot to ask if she likes to drink. You really never know, these days. I guess first I'd ask her about that. If she doesn't like rum, I'd maybe try to take her by the bat sanctuary. That's pretty romantic, in a sense. I mean like misty-valleys-and-ruined-churches romantic, not like flowers-and-chocolates romantic.</line>
    <line speaker="norm">Of course, they've got that memorial there. That's a little depressing, actually. Maybe we'd kind of sail `around` that ...</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="missed-her">
    <line speaker="norm">Damn it all, I guess I probably missed her. I wonder if she'll agree to meet me again.</line>
    <option goto="shell-understand" speaker="junebug">I'm sure she'll understand, with the weather and all.</option>
    <option goto="i-wouldnt" speaker="junebug">I wouldn't, if I thought I'd been stood up.</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="shell-understand" nextScene="head-back">
    <line speaker="norm">Nice of you to say so.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="i-wouldnt" nextScene="head-back">
    <line speaker="norm">Can't say I would either. You're probably right.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="head-back">
    <line speaker="norm">Well, I guess I'll head on back ...</line>
    <line speaker="norm">Hey, um. Supposing Loretta doesn't want to see me after all ...</line>
    <option goto="already-in-a-thing" speaker="junebug">My card is full.</option>
    <option goto="out-of-your-league" speaker="junebug">I'm out of your league.</option>

  <scene name="already-in-a-thing" nextScene="advice">
    <line speaker="norm">Oh! No, sorry, that's not what I meant.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="out-of-your-league" nextScene="advice">
    <line speaker="norm">Ha ha. I won't argue with that.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="advice" nextScene="personal-ad">
    <line speaker="norm">Actually, I wanted to ask you for some advice. I had to type up a sort of "autobiography" for the computer date, and I spent a lot of time on it but I only got one reply, and that was Loretta herself. I was happy to meet her, but ... supposing she's lost interest now ...</line>
    <line speaker="norm">Do you think you could maybe give me some feedback? It's only a paragraph or so. I have it all memorized — I spent so damn long writing it!</line>
    <line speaker="norm">OK. Here's how it goes:</line>
