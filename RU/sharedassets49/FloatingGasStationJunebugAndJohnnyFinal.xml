    <option goto="frog-memory" speaker="junebug">OK. So how does that gas station attendant remind you of a frog?</option>

    <line speaker="johnny">I was just thinking about that old man and his dog — you ever notice how he talks to his dog?</line>

  <scene name="conway-talks-to-himself" nextScene="lonely">
    <line speaker="johnny">Yeah, exactly like that. But that's how I feel when I'm talking to you, ma'am — liking I'm talking to myself. And when you're talking to me, I feel like you're talking to yourself.</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">I mean, not `literally`, but like ... that's how we are who we are, you and me.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="cant-hear-conway">
    <line speaker="johnny">Right, he's just sort of mumbling and humming, thinking out loud. It doesn't matter if he speaks clearly because the dog's only listening to his tone and his hand behind <variable name="dog-possessive-pronoun" /> ear, and <variable name="dog-possessive-pronoun" /> memory of all their time together. I think that's how it is for the old man, too ...</line>
    <option goto="lonely" speaker="junebug">Feeling lonely, cricket?</option>
    <option goto="another-person" speaker="junebug">You're wondering what it would be like to travel with a third person.</option>

  <scene name="lonely" nextScene="junebug-plan">
    <line speaker="johnny">Not exactly ...</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">Not like that guy in the gas station. That guy lets the world wash over him, static like a rock, but I — you and me both, together, I mean — we're always moving, always changing.</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">I think it's because we feel safe with each other, you know? Free. We can try stuff out — change our clothes, swap parts around, just ... `play`.</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">I'm not lonely, just curious — with another person to play with, what else could we be?</line>

  <scene name="another-person" nextScene="junebug-plan">
    <line speaker="johnny">Huh. Now `that` would be a whole new adventure, wouldn't it?</line>
