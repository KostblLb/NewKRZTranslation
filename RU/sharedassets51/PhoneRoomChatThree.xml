    <line speaker="cate">Well, no, I don't have any formal medical training or licensing. Just a lot of experience. I think most women who hire me mainly want someone in the delivery room who, uh ... doesn't treat childbirth like some kind of disease to be cured.</line>
    <line speaker="cate">I mean — no hard feelings against doctors, but they have their own process, and it can be pretty alienating sometimes.</line>
