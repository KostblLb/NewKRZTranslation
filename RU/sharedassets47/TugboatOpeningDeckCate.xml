    <line speaker="cate">Don't be too shy to close them in public. Your eyes, I mean. People will just assume you're thoughtful.</line>

    <line speaker="cate">Eye strain. <variable name="tugboat-first-tea-ingredient" /> masks the taste of the rest of it — <variable name="tugboat-second-tea-ingredient" /> in particular has an `eccentric` flavor profile. It's mushroom-based. I'm a big believer in the fungal pharmacy.</line>

    <line speaker="cate" condition="tugboat-shannon-talked-to-will">I saw you talking to Will. He's an old friend. Don't be fooled by that "burned-out" aura; he's a smart and kind man. I think his only vice is those silly scratch tickets. Speaking of which, we're coming up on our next stop shortly, refueling and picking up a few things.</line>
