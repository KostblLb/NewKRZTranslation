      A catastrophe! Or the site of some ancient catastrophe, anyway. Sure, the evidence is all around us.

    <line speaker="andrew">I think we'd all agree that's a fair assessment. How could ... wait. Let's unpack that for a moment. What makes it spooky? No: how do you know it's spooky — or would be spooky for a baby?</line>

    <line speaker="andrew">Sure, that's — but they're not just &quot;shadows,&quot; right? I mean they could be ... they're `projections`, or maybe they're ... `anatomies`. How's that? Can you tell where we are now? Surrounded by creeping anatomies?</line>

    <line speaker="andrew">Computers? Oh, now I remember. I was writing on them. I described a cave. That was my job: describe the cave. There's a great history of caves in the literature, don't you know? &quot;The walls are frozen rivers of orange stone.&quot; Isn't that `vivid`? I had a lot to live up to.</line>

  <scene name="disappointed" nextScene="history">
    <line speaker="andrew">No, it's my fault ... I shouldn't be so attached to the future. It's always getting in the way of my work. Better to be in the moment, carefully observing and documenting, with no attachment. Let me give you an example:</line>

    <line speaker="andrew">I was a grad student studying statistics when I started working with Donald on his project. He said we needed someone with a more analytical mind to do the descriptive writing. Someone who would appreciate the cave descriptions as real labor, instead of taking their authorial voice for granted.</line>
    <line speaker="andrew">Donald warned me it would be long hours of typing painstakingly detailed descriptions into the computer. And I've put in the hours! Believe me. I've put in the hours ...</line>
    <line speaker="andrew">I've described every facet of this cave in such detail that sometimes I don't know if I'm reading or looking, writing or exploring! Often, in the dark and lonely moments, I worry that in my sleep I've transcribed rooms from my dreams into the system.</line>
    <line speaker="andrew">How would we know? They could only be entered with precise, faithful detail. That's all I know how to write! And all I dream about is caves!</line>
