  <scene name="travel">
    <line speaker="ezra">Yeah. They're traveling and they want to go home. It's dark and raining, and they don't know where to go, but they're not scared. Do you think they'll figure it out?</line>
    <option goto="positive-ending" speaker="shannon">I think so.</option>
    <option goto="negative-ending" speaker="shannon">Maybe not. But they'll figure `something` out.</option>

  <scene name="home">
    <line speaker="ezra">Yeah. They're singing about their home because they're lost right now. It's a scary song.</line>
    <option goto="positive-ending" speaker="shannon">It's not scary. It's hopeful.</option>
    <option goto="negative-ending" speaker="shannon">It's scary, but they can still sing about it.</option>

  <scene name="hard-times">
    <line speaker="ezra">Yeah. Everybody has it pretty rough right now. Even if you just want to go home, you'll have problems. Like it'll be too dark and you'll get scared.</line>
    <option goto="positive-ending" speaker="shannon">It's hard sometimes, but things have a way of working out.</option>
    <option goto="negative-ending" speaker="shannon">Maybe you can just stay lost in the dark. Maybe you'll be OK with that eventually.</option>
