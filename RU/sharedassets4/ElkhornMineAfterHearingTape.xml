    <line speaker="shannon">When this mine was active, a couple of folk music archivists spent time here recording miners' songs. Really academic, ivory tower types. None of the miners really talked to them much.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">So they stayed at the margins, observed, took notes, and then sometimes they'd get someone on a lunch break to sing into their microphone.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">Then I guess the power company got some kind of interest in the project, and gave the archivists some coal scrip tokens to pay the miners with for their songs.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="archivists-again" nextScene="questions">
    <line speaker="shannon">They'd record up on that old scaffolding we saw, and I guess then they'd sequester themselves down here to listen to the recorded songs.</line>
