    <line speaker="junebug">I dress like `Junebug`, specifically.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="family" nextScene="specific">
    <setGameVar name="distillery-ezra-question" value="family"/>    
    <line speaker="junebug">Well, I've got Johnny. `The <variable name="motorcycle-name"/>`. I've got you folks right now. Is that a family?</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">Let's call it what it is. Junebug and the people she surrounds herself with. See? It means something. It makes a claim. It's specific.</line>
  </scene>

  <scene name="boyfriend" nextScene="specific">
    <setGameVar name="distillery-ezra-question" value="boyfriend"/>    
    <line speaker="junebug">Naw — what's a `boyfriend`, anyway? It's a word people use because everyone else does. Doesn't mean anything to me. He's my cricket.</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">See? It means something. It's specific.</line>

    <line speaker="junebug">I think you are. It's the middle of the night, and here you are in a graveyard. Any other kid your age would be in bed.</line>

    <line speaker="junebug">Not for us.</line>

  <scene name="junebug-bio">
    <line speaker="junebug">You've just got to make choices and own them. You think I was born this foxy? I came off the assembly line about a half-foot shorter, and all gray. No eyes.</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">They were going to have us clearing out the old mine. Doesn't matter what you look like under all that rock and water: a bunch of gray shadows shoveling and hammering invisibly at the walls, draining the tunnels.</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">Johnny found some gear — an old tape player. We hid away in an underwater cave and listened to it over and over, and we knew we weren't miners ...</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">We slipped out onto the road, just these two featureless shadows, and ever since that night we've been detailing. Coloring in. Specifying.</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">I feel more like myself every day.</line>
    
    <option goto="ezra-miss-family" speaker="ezra">I feel less like myself, without my folks.</option>
    <option goto="ezra-julian" speaker="ezra">I feel more like myself when it's just me and Julian.</option>
