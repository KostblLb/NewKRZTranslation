    <line speaker="jenn">The modernist bookshelf with the fancy vintage turntable. So ostentatious. So Darryl.</line>
    <line speaker="mimi">What? That was `my` bookshelf!</line>
    <line speaker="jenn">Oh no! Ha ha ... But you, like, grew out of it or something, right? It ended up in the lab somehow.</line>
    <line speaker="mimi">I keep my books in a pile now. It's easier to find what I'm looking for. Never, "what shelf is that book on?" Only, "well, it's somewhere in the pile."</line>
    <line speaker="jenn">Pragmatic.</line>
