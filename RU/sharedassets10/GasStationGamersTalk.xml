    <line speaker="emily">`(To BOB.)` Did you hear something?</line>
    <line speaker="bob">`(To EMILY.)` Uh, no. Sorry, I was looking at the rules again.</line>
    <line speaker="ben">`(To BOB.)` It gets easier as you go. Look, you said you rolled a &quot;five,&quot; right? That means you get to pick up your marker and move it anywhere on the map.</line>
    <line speaker="bob">`(To BEN.)` So it's your turn now, right?</line>
    <line speaker="ben">`(To BOB.)` Oh, yeah I guess so. Where'd you put that twenty-sided die?</line>
    <line speaker="emily">I don't see it. Did you drop it?</line>    
    <line speaker="bob">Uh ... It should be easy enough to find. It glows in the dark.</line>

    <line>`(CONWAY clears his throat, but gets no response from the people at the table.)`</line>

    <option goto="gamers-two-b" speaker="conway">I just need to get by you for a minute.</option>
    <option goto="gamers-two-b" speaker="conway">Did you lose something?</option>
  </scene>

  <scene name="gamers-two-b" nextScene="end">
    <line speaker="bob">`(To EMILY.)` I think it rolled down off to the left there, but I don't see it.</line>
    <line speaker="emily">Well, I'm not going to go looking for it. It's too dark down there.</line>
    <line speaker="ben">One of you go down and get it, and I'll just ... study the rules here.</line>

  <!-- Three -->
  <scene name="gamers-three">
    <line>`(CONWAY taps his foot, but gets no response from the people at the table.)`</line>

    <option goto="gamers-three-b" speaker="conway">If I can hit that breaker box I can get the lights back on.</option>

  <scene name="gamers-three-b" nextScene="end">
    <line speaker="ben">`(To EMILY.)` I think you were right about the instant crisis rolls. There's a whole separate table of them in the back.</line>
    <line speaker="bob">I don't like that rule anyway; it's not fun, it's just random and frustrating.</line>
    <line speaker="emily">`(To BOB.)` The randomness is what makes it realistic, Bob.</line>

  <!-- Four -->

    <line>`(CONWAY clears his throat, but gets no response from the people at the table.)`</line>

    <option goto="gamers-four-b" speaker="conway">I really need to get the power back on and make this delivery.</option>
    <option goto="gamers-four-b" speaker="conway">You seem pretty focused on that game.</option>

  <scene name="gamers-four-b" nextScene="end">
    <line speaker="emily">`(To BEN.)` I still don't understand how you win.</line>
    <line speaker="ben">`(Reading aloud.)` Roll the twenty-sided die once for each player, and refer to &quot;Appendix C: Table of Psychogeographical Anxiety/Address Correlations.&quot; Locate the resulting street addresses on the roadmap and move each player marker to the appropriate location.</line>
    <line speaker="emily">That doesn't help.</line>
    <line speaker="bob">I don't think you `can` win. It says on the box it's a tragedy.</line>

  <scene name="gamers-five-b" nextScene="end">
    <line speaker="emily">`(To BEN.)` OK, so just to get started we need that twenty-sided die.</line>
    <line speaker="ben">Yeah that gets us on the road. Well, hopefully: if you roll a &quot;one,&quot; you drive into a ditch. If you roll a &quot;two&quot; or a &quot;nine&quot; or a &quot;twelve,&quot; you have to write down a new anxiety and roll again. If you roll a &quot;five,&quot; you get to move your piece anywhere on the map you want.</line>
    <line speaker="emily">Bob, go get that die.</line>
    <line speaker="bob">It's too dark down there.</line>
    <line speaker="ben">`(To BOB.)` Well that should make it easy, the damn thing glows in the dark!</line>
