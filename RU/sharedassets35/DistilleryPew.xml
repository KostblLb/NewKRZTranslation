    <line speaker="shannon">When I saw Weaver ... she was on TV. I was testing a pretty simple tube repair, flipping through channels to check the saturation, and she was just `there`.</line>

    <line speaker="shannon">The camera is in the corner so it's this sort of forty-five degree angle into the room, and there's Weaver right in the center of the picture.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">I stopped turning the dial ... hell, I think I stopped `breathing`. Eventually, she spoke, but there was no real sound — just this awful hum. I read the closed captions.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">She said to go to the mine. I'd `find` something there. I can't remember her exact words. Whenever I try, I get ... distracted. Fuzzy. I —</line>
