    <line speaker="clara">What's this place like? "Dogwood Drive," it's in a small town, or ... ?</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">It ... I really don't know. Ha ha. I've got the manifest the old man had in his truck, here:</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">`(Reading.)` Lysette's Antiques ... Mail-order delivery ... No return address ... Shipping address "5 Dogwood Drive." Packing list ...</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">And then it's just numbers. I guess the inventory numbers of the antiques he was supposed to be delivering.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">Anyway, I'm glad you're coming with us.</line>
    <line speaker="clara">Yes. I'm always eager to see more of the country. And I enjoy the company. I will have to find a bus or a train to get on to Nashville by evening.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">Well, they have buses everywhere, right?</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">Or, hey â€” `I` could drive you to Nashville. Seems I have a truck now. Only ...</line>
    <line speaker="shannon" blocking="Shannon Look Shannon LookUpTarget">How are we going to get it up these stairs?</line>
    <line speaker="junebug" blocking="Junebug Look Junebug LookUpTarget">That's quite a staircase.</line>
    <option goto="route" speaker="shannon">Is there another route? A tunnel or something?</option>

    <line speaker="junebug">No way out but up.</line>
    <line speaker="junebug">I guess we could wait for the `Mammoth` to come back around and take us a little further down, but that won't be until late afternoon.</line>

  <scene name="rope" nextScene="carry">
    <line speaker="junebug">Sure, I can think of a few things. Nothing that'll get that truck up the staircase, though.</line>

    <option goto="too-much" speaker="shannon">I don't even know what's in there. What if it's too much to carry?</option>

    <line speaker="junebug">`(To JOHNNY.)` Alright, cricket, let's get this delivery packed and tied into bundles. We're hiking it upstairs.</line>
    <line speaker="ezra">What's in there?</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">Antiques, I guess.</line>
    <line speaker="ezra">"Antiques."</line>
    <line speaker="johnny">Yeah, antiques are ... It's like junk, but people will pay for it.</line>
    <line speaker="ezra">Oh.</line>
    <line speaker="shannon">`(To CLARA.)` Sorry, I guess you'll be taking the bus after all.</line>
    <line speaker="clara">It's OK. It will be an adventure.</line>
