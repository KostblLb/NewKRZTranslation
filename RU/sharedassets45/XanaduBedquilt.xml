    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">I know you think this environment will help our project, get us in touch with a deep romantic reverence for some kind of profound natural spookiness ... but I was more comfortable in our lab.</line>
    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">The university picked the worst time to cut our funding! Typical institutional stinginess and academic politics. I mean, I felt like we were getting really close to something ... something ...</line>

    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">Do you think there are paintings down here? Cave paintings, I mean. Maybe some old pottery shards, from when the world was young and early men and women huddled in these caves to ...</line>
    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">Do you know, I think cultural fossils are the saddest fossils? Sadder than animal remains, I mean ...</line>
    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">We might come across a petrified mollusk, or a partial dinosaur footprint, and we say: &quot;there was a point of contact here, where a body touched the earth, and maybe there's a little bit of evidential garbage, but the life who owned that body never cared and has moved on anyway.&quot;</line>
    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">And that's the end of it.</line>
    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">But suppose I shine my lantern on one of these walls, and I see a crude painting, thousands of years old. Two men and a woman. Charcoal and blood, on rock.</line>
    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">Someone put that there, to keep something on the rock after she passed. A hope, a relationship, or a moment. A worry, maybe ... a regret.</line>
    <line speaker="lula" style="xanadu">She made a painting to keep something alive for her, but like that dead mollusk and that itinerant dinosaur, she had to move on. Whatever it was is gone, and now we're looking at this painting. This dangling copy, with no original.</line>
